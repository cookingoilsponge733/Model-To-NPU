# SDXL scripts overview

A detailed map of the current `SDXL/` folder.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `SDXL/` currently contains **more than just the shortest happy-path**. It also includes diagnostics, parity checks, calibration helpers, QAIRT/QNN workarounds, and experimental branches. That is expected for a live R&D repository.

## How to read this map

- **core-happy-path** — part of the main documented pipeline;
- **deploy-runtime** — phone/runtime/Android deployment pieces;
- **calibration-data** — calibration/raw/input-list generation;
- **verification-debug** — parity checks, comparisons, diagnostics;
- **experimental-alternative** — research branches, not the main path;
- **utility** — helper rewriters, patches, and evaluators.

## Two real branches in this repository

### 1. Public beta runtime

This is the easier path that currently matches the main documentation:

- `phone_generate.py`
- `scripts/deploy_to_phone.py`
- split-UNet context binaries (`unet_encoder_fp16` + `unet_decoder_fp16`)
- CLIP-L / CLIP-G / VAE context binaries
- the APK in `APK/`

This branch is the best match for the current `README`s.

### 2. Experimental Lightning/QNN lab branch

This is the active research branch inside `SDXL/`:

- `convert_lightning_to_qnn.py`
- `run_phone_lightning.py`
- `run_full_phone_pipeline.py`
- `trace_unet_layer_parity.py`
- `compare_*`
- `generate_*_references.py`
- shell helpers for `ctxgen`

It matters, but it is **not the shortest public entry point** for first-time readers.

## Recommended minimum reading order

If you want the shortest useful route through the repository, start with:

1. `convert_sdxl_checkpoint_to_diffusers.py`
2. `bake_lora_into_unet.py`
3. `export_clip_vae_to_onnx.py`
4. `export_sdxl_to_onnx.py`
5. `scripts/build_all.py`
6. `scripts/deploy_to_phone.py`
7. `phone_generate.py`
8. `README_EN.md`
9. `SDXL/LESSONS_LEARNED.md`

## What belongs to the “final path” and what does not

### Closest to the public beta path

- `phone_generate.py`
- `scripts/deploy_to_phone.py`
- tokenizer + context binaries
- APK

### Not the final user-facing path, but active lab infrastructure

These files should **not** be treated as mandatory for an ordinary user:

- all `compare_*`
- all `generate_*reference*`
- `trace_unet_layer_parity.py`
- `check_encoder_outputs.py`
- `measure_ram.py`
- `test_distillation_loras.py`
- the AI Hub branch (`export_and_compile_aihub.py`, `export_split_unet.py`)

## Why there are so many of them — and why they are not junk

This collection grew out of real engineering work:

- some files exist because QAIRT/QNN has edge cases;
- some exist to verify parity across PyTorch, ONNX, and the phone;
- some exist because the split-UNet and Lightning/full-UNet branches evolved in parallel;
- some are simply honest R&D infrastructure, not “extra scripts”.

That is why the README now needs to clearly separate:

- **what a newcomer should run**;
- **what the author/researcher needs**;
- **what is still experimental**.
