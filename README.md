## Changelog

- **0.2.2** — APK/runtime snapshot refreshed for the current validation cycle: TAESD preview wiring was repaired for the QNN path, APK preview timing parsing now handles `QNN GPU` preview lines again, and the deploy/docs/sample notes were synchronized around the current phone runtime layout while early CFG-step tuning remains under active investigation.
- **0.2.1** — APK now routes transient runtime files (`WORK_DIR`, generated PNGs, and live preview frames) through app-private cache directories instead of shared storage, while keeping the deployed model tree in the public phone path.
- **0.2.0** — phone runtime and APK now show live **CPU / GPU / NPU** temperatures, default to QNN `sustained_high_performance`, auto-enable HTP backend extensions when `libQnnHtpNetRunExtensions.so` is deployed, and the current full `8`-step progressive-CFG best path reached about **79.7–80.6s total** on OnePlus 13.
- **0.1.3** — phone runtime and APK launch path now enable QNN `mmap` by default, repo-visible SDXL speed/overhead probes were added, and the current control run reached **104.4s total** at `1024×1024`, `8` steps, `CFG=1.0` on OnePlus 13.
- **0.1.2-beta** — APK now exposes a **½-CFG** toggle that applies guidance only to the first `ceil(steps / 2)` denoising steps; added a dedicated UNet quantization review with per-block risk notes and safer experiment boundaries.
- **0.1.2** — APK gained optional **Live Preview (TAESD)** using `phone_gen/taesd_decoder.onnx` + `onnxruntime` on the phone.
- **Runtime / preview fixes** — TAESD preview path was repaired end-to-end, including export, phone runtime wiring, and deployment docs.
- **APK log parsing fixes** — timing parsing and progress extraction were cleaned up so CLIP / UNet / VAE status reporting no longer drifts on mixed log lines.
- **Docs / sample sync** — rooted phone sample and the live phone layout docs were synchronized with the current shared-path runtime structure.

## What this repo already demonstrates

- SDXL can be pushed all the way to a **real Snapdragon phone NPU**;
- the runtime is not just a benchmark stub — it includes prompt processing, scheduler logic, PNG output, and an APK UI;
- the repository now openly separates:
  - the **public beta runtime path**,
  - the **build/export path**,
  - and the **experimental lab scripts** used to debug QAIRT/QNN edge cases.

All gallery samples and the currently documented phone-side examples are **1024×1024** outputs from the current Lightning-merged SDXL path.

## Proof that it actually runs on-device

Compared with the earlier public on-device screenshot, the current `v0.2.0` screenshot shows:

- **273.6s → 100.8s total**;
- **172.8s faster** wall-clock time;
- about **63.2% improvement** for this README-visible screenshot comparison.

This `v0.2.0` comparison is meant as the new README-visible progress marker for the shared public runtime path.

## Why CFG is much slower here

For this project, **CFG above 1.0 is not a tiny tweak**.

- CFG means the model needs both **conditional** and **unconditional** predictions;
- this repository uses a **split UNet** (`encoder` + `decoder`) on the phone;
- so one logical UNet pass is already two QNN executions;
- naive CFG therefore turns each denoising step into **four** phone-side UNet subprocess calls:
  - uncond encoder,
  - uncond decoder,
  - cond encoder,
  - cond decoder.

The current phone runtime now batches cond+uncond work more efficiently, so it no longer pays the worst possible subprocess overhead every step. But the NPU still has to do roughly **double the real denoising work**, so generation time is still close to **2× slower** than the no-CFG path.

In short:

- **CFG = 1.0 or lower** → cheapest path;
- **CFG > 1.0** → sharper/more guided output, but much more UNet work;
- on this stack, that trade-off is very visible in wall-clock time.

## Current repository layout

- `SDXL/` — SDXL conversion, calibration, verification, QNN, and runtime experiments;
- `APK/` — Android app for on-device generation;
- `scripts/` — deploy and helper scripts;
- `tokenizer/` — shared tokenizer files;
- `phone_generate.py` — standalone phone-side generator used by the public beta runtime path.

If more model families are added later, each of them should get its own top-level folder alongside `SDXL/`.
